								<p>I was a collector representative worked diligently for an Australian collector company. I enjoyed the job but harbored a strong passion for data analysis. I knew that in today's data-driven world, this skill could open up exciting opportunities.</p>
								<p>I decided to take the leap and pursue a career as a Data Analyst. I began by enrolling in online courses to learn the fundamentals of data analysis, statistics, and programming languages like Python. I spent many late nights studying, determined to gain the necessary skills.</p>
								<p>After completing the courses, I started applying for Data Analyst positions in various companies. I tailored my resume to highlight my relevant skills and even included my experience as a collector representative, emphasizing my ability to handle large volumes of data. I was excited and determined to get my first job as Data Analyst.</p>
								<p>Now as a Data Analyst, I found myself working on exciting projects, analyzing data to uncover valuable insights, and helping the company make informed decisions. I also continued to expand my skills, eventually becoming proficient in Tableau and further enhancing my Python knowledge.</p>
